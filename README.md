Create a folder with the index and generateLicense js files. Include the package.json file by running npm install <package> --save for both the inquirer package and the fs package.
## Usage
This application allows the user to enter in the desired README content without having to do the basic formatting. It generates a file which provides a finished README, or at the very least, a solid template that can be further edited.
